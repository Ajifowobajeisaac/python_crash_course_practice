# python_crash_course_practice
A practice repository for sharpening my python skills.

The code practice is inspired by the the book of the same name written by Eric
Matthes

While the structure and examples are similar, I personalised most of the examples
and use contexts that help me understand the concepts better.

I also styled the repo in a way that is engaging, simple and explanatory so others
can benefit.
